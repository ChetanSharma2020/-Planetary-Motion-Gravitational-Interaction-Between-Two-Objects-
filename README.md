# -Planetary-Motion-Gravitational-Interaction-Between-Two-Objects-
This project explores the gravitational interactions between two-point masses in space, focusing on deriving and solving the equations of motion that govern their trajectories. Using Newton's law of gravitation and laws of motion, a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) was formulated to describe the dynamic relationship between the two masses. The ODEs were then solved numerically using a custom implementation of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method in Python, as required, without relying on built-in ODE solvers. Various initial conditions and mass ratios were investigated to simulate well-known cases of gravitational motion, such as the orbit of a smaller mass around a much larger one. This project successfully models the gravitational behavior of two-body systems and provides insights into fundamental celestial mechanics, with applications in planetary and orbital dynamics.
